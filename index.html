        <p>Long story short about this nft collection called “places to visit”</p>
        <p>I started working on it at the middle of January when realised that I got on a wave of inspiration taking my ideas to live, to nft world and placing some sort of my footprint inside community and my life. From the early start I wanted to create something personal with great field of ideas inside of it and this something personal became an idea of visiting places online and making a picture of place where I wanted to be offline. So, the idea of this collection is heavily based on what I feel and think. As always people often sacrifice travel and time with ourselves in favor of our careers. 80% of the citizens of my country do not have a passport at all and have never traveled anywhere, sometimes even from their own city. We don’t have to blame ourselves, we just need to dream about visiting and expanding our view borders.</p>
        <p>This collection was made to be a kind of reminder of how important it is not to deny yourself the pleasure of exploring the world and our beautiful planet. To be a kind of trigger or medium, to look at or possess, and to be carried away in one's imagination for a moment. To make a kind of mental journey.</p>
        <p>I got 7 locations which I wanted to visit and stated to think how could I pack them. And I remembered that in childhood there was a PS1 with game sharing and this outstanding atmosphere coming from the visual I got from it, this feelings were truly rare and great of how technology changed life of people. Inside every game I played, there was a great visual which got a lot of restrictions due to hardware, but still was looking impressive. I remembered this feeling of being free of borders in my childhood while playing games and decided to pack all 7 pictures in PSX render effects. I want people to feel the dreaming idea with this collection and this stylisation, anything can possible if you dream.</p>
        <p>The pricing is simple — I used ISO 3166-1 codes as the start price for each picture, to create another layer of idea to this collection. Dream and visit places with me via internet.</p>
        <p>Sincerely, Mark</p><br>
        <p>Also, I would like to mention one more thing. This collection was going to be released in February-March, but things went bad at 24-th of February. I won’t support any violence. #nowar</p>

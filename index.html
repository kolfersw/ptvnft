        <p>I want to tell you a small story. I’ll try to be short, if it doesn’t happen -- sorry. Also big
            apology for typos.</p>
        <p>The beggining of this small collection was placed at the start of January. Since this moment I
            started to think what I want to create without placing myself in borders of work, freelance and etc.
            About immediately I got a very bitter understanding that all my entire life I was only working.
            Insted of travelling, my desires only were to achive insignificant carrer growth, to get more free
            money, some connections in businesses. And now I 25 and traveled somewhere in mother Russia, I’ve
            been in Egypt and Boulgaria, but it will be great to get new neural connections by travelling,
            talking and looking around being in another country. No, not saying that I’m upset and feeling like
            I wasted my time -- no. Every experience in our lifes is great and if I doesn’t lived like this I
            could never reach this point of inspiration to travel and discover new -- also, this collection
            were’t able to be here.</p>
        <p>After getting through this experience I aimed myself and theme of realization, placed an idea and
            starting growing other ideas around it. This collection as you understood called -- places to visit.
            I started thinking about every place I wanted to visit in each life section (from 4-25) -- the list
            was huge, so I decided to restrict myself with number -- 7 (is a magical number for me). Choosing 7
            location, when I got like 54 was a bit hard, and also I graded them from 1 to 7 (that was hard too).
            At the end I recieved 7 postcards with some info inside -- location, coordintes, desired time,
            desired date, difficulty of visit, grade of this card and also a datamatrix code (wanted to add an
            idea of letter stamp, like in letters). Precisely because of datamatrix code and table layout inside
            this cards I’ve recreated a letter idea -- with feeling that it was sent from another city or
            country. Letters are the best way to communicate, I always loved them, because they got feeling of
            being human and have soul in each.</p>
        <p>Great, I’ve got an idea, got a package and need to start working on visualization of a place, how can
            I handle it? I remembered that, in childhood appearing of new technologies like -- telephones,
            computers, game consoles exploded my heart and head with pure happiness and feeling free. I remember
            playing my first games in PS1, the graphics turned for me like something unreal and I didn’t
            understand how does it even possible. So, this feelings I wanted to put inside my collection, so I
            used PSX render for all my pictures and tried to stay inside PS1 restrictions in triangles, textures
            resolution. This render enriches this collections with life.</p>
        <p>At the end, we got 7 postcards with great places to visit which are stylized with PSX render. First
            buyer will recive a postcard with art via mail with my special message.</p>
        <p><br>DISCLAIMER</p>
        <p>Part of this collections were created after February events, because of that you can see a gap
            between postcards release. I don’t support war and this nightmare must be ended as soon as possible.
